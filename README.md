## Visual Reasoning
1. Mao, J., Gan, C., Kohli, P., Tenenbaum, J., & Wu, J. (2019). The Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner: Interpreting Scenes, Words, and Sentences From Natural Supervision. In International Conference on Learning Representations.  
 **Dataset**: CLEVR & VQS;  
 **Key points**: Learning visual concepts and sentence semantic parsing jointly with only image and QA pairs.
 



## Abstract Reasoning
1. Zheng, K., Zha, Z. J., & Wei, W. (2019). Abstract Reasoning with Distracting Features. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (pp. 5834-5845).   
  **Dataset**: Raven & PGM  
  **Key Points**: Distracting features have negative influence on learning reasoning tasks, but its influence could be mediated by the order of training samples. This work uses reinforcement learning to train a teacher model that makes a curriculum for a student model to learn the reasoning task.
